Advances in Data Mining:
------------------------

# Motto

> It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.
> Sherlock Holmes

> Data should be at the heart of strategic decision making in businesses, whether they are huge multinationals or small family-run operations. Data can provide insights that help you answer your key business questions. Data leads to insights; business owners and managers can turn those insights into decisions and actions that improve the business. This is the power of data.

Projects:
---------

You may work on projects in a group of 2-4 people. You cannot work with same person in both projects.
You will present your results during classes, but you should submit your solution to GitHub before classes.
Projects that are not presented will not be scores. 
Al least 50% of the team is required to be present during the project presentation.

1. Project - Classification

2. Project - Clustering

Grade:
------

Final grade will be based on points from projects (each project id 15+20+25 points, different number of points for each phase of the project) and 10 home works (each home work is for 4 points), and final test 40 points.


Homeworks:
----------
There will be some home works after some classes (around 10 home works).
Each correct solution gives you 4 points.
Home works have to be done personally. No group work here!
Home works have to be submitted to github not later than 1 week after announcement.
